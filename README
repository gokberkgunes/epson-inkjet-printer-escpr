A PKGBUILD file is provided to build this for Arch-based GNU/Linux distributions. The PKGBUILD file is modified form of an AUR
package: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/epson-inkjet-printer-escpr

```sh
git clone 'https://github.com/gokberkgunes/epson-inkjet-printer-escpr/'
cd epson-inkjet-printer-escpr
makepkg -si
```


The source code files are stored in branch `source`, and these files are obtained from the official website, specifically:
